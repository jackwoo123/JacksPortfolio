       <h3>Software One</h3>
       <br><br>
       <p>This class is the inital course that all students need to take for
         Computer Science at OSU.  We learned Java, XML, and RSS along some
         data structures such as queues and maps.

        <br><br>
        <h3>Software Two</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Software Two focused on data structures further like sets, stacks, queues, and more maps.
          We learned about kernal interfaces which was really interesting to me.
          Kernal interfaces use the same interfaces, but use different code to
          achieve the method contracts.  This was the main topic because we had
          alot of labs that implemented a map, using a set for example.

        <br><br>
        <h3>Data Foundations One</h3>
        <br>
        <p>In Data Foundations One we learned alot about the runtime of algorithms.
          One gripe I had about this class is that we did not learn about the memory
          notation!  It was pretty stright forward learning memory notation but I
          wish we were taught this formally.  This class was done mostly in
          pusedo code and Python.

        <br><br>
        <h3>Systems Foundations 1</h3>
        <br>
        <p>This class so far has been my favorite.  We learned about low level
          programming, using the programming languages C and Assembler.  While
          this was also my favorite class, it was also the hardest class in my
          opinion.  Learning pointers was quite possibly the most difficult process
          for me because I was so familiar to Java and other Object Oriented Languages.

		<h3>Interactive Systems</h3>
		<br>
		<p>This class has me creating a game in C# using the monogame engine.  I will be taking this class in the Autumn 2021 semester.
